 honored today commencement one finest universities world never graduated college truth told closest ever gotten college graduation today want tell three stories life big deal just three stories 

 first story connecting dots 
 dropped reed college first months stayed around drop another months really quit drop 

 started born biological mother young unwed college graduate student decided put adoption felt strongly adopted college graduates everything set adopted birth lawyer wife except popped decided last minute really wanted girl parents waiting list got call middle night asking unexpected baby boy want said course biological mother later found mother never graduated college father never graduated high school refused sign final adoption papers relented months later parents promised someday go college 

 years later go college naively chose college almost expensive stanford workingclass parents savings spent college tuition six months see value idea wanted life idea college going help figure spending money parents saved entire life decided drop trust work ok pretty scary time looking back one best decisions ever made minute dropped stop taking required classes interest begin dropping ones looked interesting 

 romantic dorm room slept floor friends rooms returned coke bottles Ã« deposits buy food walk miles across town every sunday night get one good meal week hare krishna temple loved much stumbled following curiosity intuition turned priceless later let give one example 

reed college time offered perhaps best calligraphy instruction country throughout campus every poster every label every drawer beautifully hand calligraphed dropped take normal classes decided take calligraphy class learn learned serif san serif typefaces varying amount space different letter combinations makes great typography great beautiful historical artistically subtle way science capture found fascinating 

none even hope practical application life ten years later designing first macintosh computer came back designed mac first computer beautiful typography never dropped single course college mac never multiple typefaces proportionally spaced fonts since windows just copied mac likely personal computer never dropped never dropped calligraphy class personal computers might wonderful typography course impossible connect dots looking forward college clear looking backwards ten years later 

 connect dots looking forward can connect looking backwards trust dots will somehow connect future trust something gut destiny life karma whatever approach never let made difference life 

 second story love loss 

 lucky found loved early life woz started apple parents garage worked hard years apple grown just two us garage billion company employees just released finest creation macintosh year earlier just turned got fired can get fired company started well apple grew hired someone thought talented run company first year things went well visions future began diverge eventually falling board directors sided publicly focus entire adult life gone devastating 

 really know months felt let previous generation entrepreneurs dropped baton passed met david packard bob noyce tried apologize screwing badly public failure even thought running away valley something slowly began dawn still loved turn events apple changed one bit rejected still love decided start 

 see turned getting fired apple best thing ever happened heaviness successful replaced lightness beginner less sure everything freed enter one creative periods life 

 next five years started company named next another company named pixar fell love amazing woman become wife pixar went create worlds first computer animated feature film toy story now successful animation studio world remarkable turn events apple bought next retuned apple technology developed next heart apples current renaissance laurene wonderful family together 

 pretty sure none happened fired apple awful tasting medicine guess patient needed sometimes life hits head brick lose faith convinced thing kept going loved got find love true work lovers work going fill large part life way truly satisfied believe great work way great work love found yet keep looking settle matters heart know find like great relationship just gets better better years roll keep looking find settle 

 third story death 

 read quote went something like live day last someday certainly right made impression since past years looked mirror every morning asked today last day life want today whenever answer many days row know need change something 

remembering dead soon important tool ever encountered help make big choices life almost everything external expectations pride fear embarrassment failure things just fall away face death leaving truly important remembering going die best way know avoid trap thinking something lose already naked reason follow heart 

 year ago diagnosed cancer scan morning clearly showed tumor pancreas even know pancreas doctors told almost certainly type cancer incurable expect live longer three six months doctor advised go home get affairs order doctors code prepare die means try tell kids everything thought next years tell just months means make sure everything buttoned will easy possible family means say goodbyes 

 lived diagnosis day later evening biopsy stuck endoscope throat stomach intestines put needle pancreas got cells tumor sedated wife told viewed cells microscope doctors started crying turned rare form pancreatic cancer curable surgery surgery fine now 

 closest facing death hope closest get decades lived can now say bit certainty death useful purely intellectual concept 

 one wants die even people want go heaven want die get yet death destination share one ever escaped death likely single best invention life lifes change agent clears old make way new right now new someday long now will gradually become old cleared away sorry dramatic quite true 

 time limited waste living someone elses life trapped dogma living results peoples thinking let noise s opinions drown inner voice important courage follow heart intuition somehow already know truly want become everything else secondary 

 young amazing publication called whole earth catalog one bibles generation created fellow named stewart brand far menlo park brought life poetic touch late s personal computers desktop publishing made typewriters scissors polaroid cameras sort like google paperback form years google came along idealistic overflowing neat tools great notions 

stewart team put several issues whole earth catalog run course put final issue mids age back cover final issue photograph early morning country road kind might find hitchhiking adventurous beneath words stay hungry stay foolish farewell message signed stay hungry stay foolish always wished now graduate begin anew wish 

stay hungry stay foolish 

thank much
